# QA & Italian Language Portfolio

This repository contains NDA-safe examples demonstrating my approach to
quality assurance and Italian language validation for games and consumer technology.

My work focuses on identifying player-facing issues, validating localized content
for accuracy and natural flow, and ensuring functional correctness across UI,
dialogue, and gameplay states.

## Areas of Focus

- Gameplay, UI, and regression testing
- Italian language validation (UI text, dialogue, system messaging)
- Bug documentation and reproduction steps
- Contextual review across gameplay states
- Clear communication across cross-functional teams
